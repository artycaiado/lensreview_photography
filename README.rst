System Requirements
--------------------------
There are a few system packages that must be installed in order to install the
necessary python modules.  There is a bash shell script that can be run to
install the necessary system requirements on CentOS 6 via yum, and Mac OSX if
you are using homebrew.


Requirements Python 2.7.6
--------------------------
The required pip modules for Python 2.7.6 are the ones listed in the
requirements.txt.

Trying to code with Python 3 in mind, so some of the modules are different.
The Python3 requirements (not currently working) are in requirements/requirements3.txt.
